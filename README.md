## How to install

Adding a plugin is as easy as putting the directory into the directory `{MODELER_LOCATION}/plugins`.
On macOS you have to create the `plugins` folder in this directoy: `/Users/{USER_NAME}/Library/Application Support/camunda-modeler`. A compressed version is always available in the release section.
